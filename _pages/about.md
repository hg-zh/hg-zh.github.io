I am an Assistant Professor in [STOR](https://stor.unc.edu) and [SDSS](https://datascience.unc.edu) at UNC-Chapel Hill, from Jan 2026. Before joining UNC, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at UC Davis, working with Professors [Hans-Georg Müller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/) and [Jane-Ling Wang](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~wang/). I got my Ph.D. in Statistics from Peking University in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Fang Yao](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yaof/Homepage.html).


## My current research interests include:

### Theory and methodology for:
- Statistical modeling and inference for object data, including but not limited to distributions, trees, and compositional data
- Functional data with complex structure, including discretely observed and non-Euclidean data
- Learning theory, generalization bound for deep neural network
- Model agnostic method and its applications in real-world dataset, e.g., anomalies detection
- Dynamical systems and its applications in information retrieval

### Application areas:
- Longitudinal/Compositional data in biological and medical sciences
- Brain image data (MRI, fMRI)
