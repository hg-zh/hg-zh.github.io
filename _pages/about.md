I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Davis, working with Professors [Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/) and [Jane-Ling Wang](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~wang/). I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Peking University in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Fang Yao](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yaof/Homepage.html).

My research spans methodology, theory, and application in statistics. During my Ph.D. at Peking University, I focused on optimal convergence and phase transitions for discretely observed functional data, particularly those involving inverse problems. Under the supervision of Prof. Fang Yao and in collaboration with Dongyi Wei, we addressed an important unresolved issue in functional data analysis (FDA). We developed a unified theory for the optimal convergence rates and phase transitions for a diverging number of eigenfunctions, which is important for subsequent analyses involving inverse problems in FDA.

## My current research interests includes:

### Theory and methodology for:
- Statistical modeling and inference for object data, including but not limited to distributions, trees, and compositional data
- Functional data with complex structure, including discretely observed and non-Euclidean data
- Learning theory, generalization bound for deep neural network
- Model agnostic method and its applications in real-world dataset, e.g., anomalies detection

### Application areas:
- Longitudinal/Compositional data in biological and medical sciences
- Brain image data (MRI, fMRI)
