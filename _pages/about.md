I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Davis, working with Professors [Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/) and [Jane-Ling Wang](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~wang/). I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Peking University in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Fang Yao](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yaof/Homepage.html).

My research spans methodology, theory and application in statistics. During my Ph.D. at Peking University, I focused on optimal convergence and phase transitions in discretely observed functional data, particularly those involving inverse problems. We developed a [unified theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08768) for the optimal convergence rates and phase transitions for a diverging number of eigenfunctions, addressing an open problem important for subsequent analyses.

## My current research interests includes:

### Theory and methodology for:
- Statistical modeling and inference for object data, including but not limited to distributions, trees, and compositional data
- Functional data with complex structure, including discretely observed and non-Euclidean data
- Learning theory, generalization bound for deep neural network
- Model agnostic method and its applications in real-world dataset, e.g., anomalies detection

### Application areas:
- Longitudinal/Compositional data in biological and medical sciences
- Brain image data (MRI, fMRI)
